  svk branch
    * Creating an offline branch on trunk will not create a local branch called
      trunk
    * The --info option now displays the large revision it was merged from
    * --create will fail if the target exists in the local svk repository
    * -a is now available to mean --all
    * New `svk branch --pull' command, accepts the following options:
        * --lump
        * --local
        * --from <source branch>
        * --from <source branch> <destination branch>
    * svk br --checkout to checkout path works
    * --from BRANCH
    * --from-tag
    * Fixes so svk shows the proper branch name (branch xxx/yyy only showed xxx)
    * Fixes so svk can trace project ancestory better when a branch goes offline
