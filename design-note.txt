svn aims to be the compelling replacement for cvs, svk will be the
replacement for others, including people who already switched from svn
to other scm, and people who had not started using scm.

usage scenario:

svk mirror //projectA/fromcvs vcp+cvs://...
svk branch //projectA/fromcvs //projectA/trunk

svk mirror //svn/trunk http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk
svk branch //svn/trunk/subversion/libsvn_fs //svn/local-fs
svk branch //svn/trunk //svn/local-works

svk sync //svn/trunk
svk sync //svn/local-works # does automatic mergedown

svk merge //svn/trunk //svn/local-works

=================
resource definition

/<depot_name>/<path>

depot_name default to something like SVK_DEPOT if ignored 

name mapping stored in .svk/<someting>

=================

svk co //svn/local-works svn
  => stores co information
svk ci 
svk diff
svk 

=> is it easy to put scheduled info in fs txn directly?


==== notes
* svn wc is too slow and generally an overkill when used with ra_local
*
