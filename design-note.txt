Design Notes for SubversionKeeper

Subversion aims to take over the CVS user base, while SubversionKeeper
attempts to take over the others - including people who already
switched to other scm, and people who had not started using scm. It is
written in Perl and is using subversion's underlying filesystem.

advanced usage scenario:

svk mirror //projectA/fromcvs vcp+cvs://...
svk branch //projectA/fromcvs //projectA/trunk

svk mirror //svn/trunk http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk
svk branch //svn/trunk/subversion/libsvn_fs //svn/local-fs
svk branch //svn/trunk //svn/local-works

svk sync //svn/trunk
svk sync //svn/local-works # does automatic mergedown

svk merge //svn/trunk //svn/local-works

=================
resource definition

/<depot_name>/<path>

depot_name default to something like SVK_DEPOT if ignored 

=================

svk co //svn/local-works svn

svk ci 
svk diff
svk 

=> is it easy to put scheduled info in fs txn directly?


==== notes
* svn wc is too slow and generally an overkill when used with ra_local
*
