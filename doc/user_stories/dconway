* someone will send me the url for a repository
* i want to tell svk "i'm interested in this repository"
* "I want to say svk http://url"
    * svk will magically check out the head of that repository into my cwd
      i can make edits and changes
      once I'm done, I can say "send them back"
        if I'm a committer, default to online.
        if I'm not a committer, default to offline.

        if sending to remote and I fail, fall back to offline mode.

* The only command I want to type while developing is

    "checkpoint"
        * save changes for my own use. something I can backtrack from.

    "submit"
        * save changes and push them up to "upstream"
        * this is either directly if I'm a committer or by generating a patch
          and emailing it. I don't want to know who I should send it. The 
          repository should have this info automatically. It should be as
          automated as possible


* I also want to walk back through my checkpoints
    and revert to a checkpoint.

    Show me a timeline of what I did. 
    Let me walk up the timeline to a particular place, and either revert one change or a range of changes.
    
    This should be a visual, interactive changes.   vi keybindings would be ideal 
    
     Possibly:
        Let me delete items in the changelog and have svk do the right thing

     "svk review" should have an interactive interface that presents the
        changes, navigatable with j/k keys, and allow for revert/view/edit_log
        Also, a flip view between thread view and chronological view.
        The threading view would become like gmail "conversations", in which
        you can "unfold" something and see all subsequent changes that depend on it.
        
        To mark changes, usually you select "up to" a point (but also possible to
        tag individual "threads"), then forward these changes to some upstream
        Under this metaphor, to commit a new change is like hitting "reply".


svk http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/
cd pugs
# ...do changes...
svk ci # checkpoint - ask for one-line log
# ...do changes...
svk ci # checkpoint - ask for one-line log
# happy!

svk review # see what I've done...
# interactive navigation interface pops up
in that interface, some common operations
    - "I'm happy with everthing so far, send them all back to upstream"
    - "I'd like to tag a thread/range and send/push it back (choose the one that applies)"
    - "I'm so unhappy with it, I'd like to grey out parts of them and see what happens"
    - "I'm _so_ unhappy, I'd like to revert the damage I've done"

while it's doing review, on the background do a quick check to the server
(if you are online - if you are offline then it should say so) and prompt
that "there's 137 new changes on the server. download it now? [Y/n]" or
saying "there's no new changes on the server."  This is done on a per-repo
basis, based on the directory you are in.

# 
svk pull -a

# <fnord>
    svk push # pushes back to openfoundry if damian is committer
    svk send # or to perl6-compiler@perl.org if damian is not
# </fnord>
