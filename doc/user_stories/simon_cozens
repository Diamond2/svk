Subject: Something I would love from svk 
 
You may already be able to do this - if so it needs better documentation. :) 
 
One of the reasons why I don't use version control as much as I should is
that it always seems to be too cumbersome to set up. Once I have two computers 
set up both pointing at the right repository, I'm happy to commit and update 
every time I hack; if I don't have that, I won't bother. 
 
So what I would love to see is a one-command "bring this directory under 
version control, creating me a repository in ~/svk/ if necessary" which echos
to the terminal another command, to be run on another host, which checks out 
the just-created project from the remote repository. 
 
Basically, anything that removes the amount of thought required to get a 
project under version control will improve the updtake of version control. 
 
What do you think? 
 
Simon
