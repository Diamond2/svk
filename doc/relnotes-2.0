Hi all,

On behave of the SVK team, I'm pleased to announce SVK 2.0.0.  This is
the first major release after 18 months of development since SVK 1.0
was released in May 2005.  Although we didn't make it by Christmas, we
hope you had a great holiday and wish you a productive year in 2007
with new SVK.

We have been testing the release for daily development and recommend
upgrading from 1.0, particularly because 2.0 gives more correct
results on merges in various cases.

The details changelogs are at the end.  Here are some of the major new
features:

* Interactive commits

  You can now use "svk commit --interactive".  svk will work you
  through each chunk of changes in each file, and let you decide
  exactly which ones you want to commit.

* Floating checkout

  You can now use "svk checkout --float" to have the checkout metadata
  stored in the top-level directory of the checkout copy.  This allows
  you to move the checkout copy around without having to use "svk
  checkout --relocate".

* View support

  svk's "views" are much like views in databases. You can now set up a
  "view" that is actually a map to different parts of a
  repository. You can then check out the "view" and work with it as if
  it's just an ordinary svk checkout path.

  Please note that this feature is still not recommended for
  production use, as some commands do not work properly in view
  checkouts.

* Log filter plugins

  You can now write custom log processing plugins for filtering and
  displaying log messages; svk ships with several, and others are
  available on CPAN.  For example, try "svk log --filter 'author
  clkao'" or "svk log --output stat" (the latter requires
  SVK::Log::Filter::Stats from CPAN).

* Better copy and rename support across merge.

  This solves the problem described in:

  http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2005-08/0712.shtml

* Pipelined sync support

  You should notice significant sync performance improvements if you
  have both Subversion 1.4 on the client and the server.

* Startup time improvements

* Many, many bugfixes and tiny features
