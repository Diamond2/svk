Hi all,

I'm glad to announce svk 2.0 technology preview 1 (tp1); we are on
the way to our 2.0 release, scheduled by Christmas.

Although this is not a stable release, we have been using this version
for daily development without issues.  So please upgrade if you'd like
to help with testing and to try out the new features below.

This is the first major release after 18 months of development since
svk 1.0 was released in May 2005, and there have been exciting improvements
and features since then.  Here are some highlights:

* Interactive commits

  You can now use "svk commit --interactive".  svk will work you
  through each chunk of changes in each file, and let you decide exactly
  which ones you want to commit.

* Floating checkout

  You can now use "svk checkout --float" to have the checkout metadata
  stored in the toplevel directory of the checkout copy.  This
  allows you to move the checkout copy around without having to use
  "svk checkout --relocate".

* View support

  svk's "views" are much like views in databases. You can now set up a
  "view" that is actually a map to different parts of a
  repository. You can then check out the "view" and work with it as if
  it's just an ordinary svk checkout path.

  Please note that this feature is still of beta-quality; some
  commands do not work properly in view checkouts.  We plan to fix
  them before the tp2 release.

* Log filter plugins

  You can now write custom log processing plugins for filtering and displaying
  log messages; svk ships with several, and others are available on CPAN.  For
  example, try "svk log --filter 'author clkao'" or "svk log --output stat" (the
  latter requires SVK::Log::Filter::Stats from CPAN).

* Better copy and rename support across merge.

  This solves the problem described in:

* Startup time improvements

* Many, many bugfixes and tiny features


Cheers,
CLK
