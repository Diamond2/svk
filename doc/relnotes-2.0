Hi all,

I'm glad to announce svk 2.0 technology preview 1 (tp1), and we are on
the way to 2.0 release, scheduled by Christmas.

Although this is not a stable release, we have been using the version
for daily development without issues.  So please upgrade if you'd like
to help testing and try out the new features below.

This is the first major release after 18 months of development since
svk 1.0 was release May 2005, and there has been exciting improvements
and features since then.  Here are some hilights:

* Interactive commits

  You can now use "svk commit --interactive".  svk will work you
  through every chunks of changes in each files, and let you decide if
  you want to commit them.

* Floating checkout

  You can now use "svk checkout --float" to have the checkout meta
  data stored in the toplevel directory of the checkout copy.  This
  allows you to move the checkout copy around.

* view support

  The term "view" is much like what you know about it in database. With
  svk's view support, you can set up a "view" that is actually a map to
  the different parts of a repository. You can then check out the
  "view" and work with it as if you're with yet another svk checkout path.

  Please note that the feature is still of beta-quality, some
  commands are not working properly in view checkouts.  We plan to
  have them fixed before the tp2 release.

* log filter plugins

  try "svk log --filter 'author clkao'"
  and "svk log --output stat" (requires SVK::Log::Filter::Stats from CPAN)

* Better copy and rename support across merge.

  This solves the problem described in:

* startup time improvements


Cheers,
CLK
